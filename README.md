# KonPlus
This program is a KonPlus's source that extends additional functions of Discord based on Node.js.  
It is a bot that aims to need the functions in the Discord server activity, not to develop the various functions mounted on popular bots.
In other words, it is a bot that I make to study the programming language Node.js (JavaScript) or to study the concept of Discord Development.
