# KonPlus
This program is a bot's source that extends the functionality of the messenger program Discord based on Node.js.  
It is a bot that aims to implement the functions necessary during the activity, not to develop the various functions mounted on many bots.  
In other words, it's a bot that you make to study the programming language Node.js (JavaScript) or to study the concept of Discord Development.
